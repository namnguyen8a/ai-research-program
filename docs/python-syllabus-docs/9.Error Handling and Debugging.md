Let's explore exception handling and debugging techniques in Python:

### Exception Handling

#### Understanding Exceptions and Errors

- Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupt the normal flow of instructions.
- Errors are issues that prevent the program from running correctly.

#### Try-Except Blocks

- Try-except blocks are used to handle exceptions gracefully, allowing the program to continue running despite encountering errors.
- The `try` block contains the code that may raise an exception, and the `except` block specifies how to handle the exception.

```python
# Example: Try-Except Block
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Division by zero")
```

#### Handling Specific Exceptions and Raising Exceptions

- You can specify different `except` blocks to handle specific exceptions separately.
- You can raise exceptions using the `raise` keyword to indicate errors or unexpected conditions in your code.

```python
# Example: Handling Specific Exceptions and Raising Exceptions
try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    if num < 0:
        raise ValueError("Number must be positive")
except ValueError as e:
    print("Error:", e)
```

### Debugging Techniques

#### Using Debugging Tools: Print Statements, Logging Module

- Print statements: Inserting print statements at various points in the code to inspect the values of variables and track the program's execution flow.
- Logging module: Using the `logging` module to log messages at different levels (e.g., debug, info, warning, error) to a file or console for debugging purposes.

```python
# Example: Debugging with Print Statements
def divide(x, y):
    print("Dividing", x, "by", y)
    return x / y

result = divide(10, 0)

# Example: Debugging with Logging Module
import logging

logging.basicConfig(filename="debug.log", level=logging.DEBUG)
logging.debug("Debugging information")
logging.info("Informational message")
logging.warning("Warning message")
logging.error("Error message")
logging.critical("Critical error message")
```

#### Debugging with Python Debugger (pdb)

- Python provides the `pdb` module for interactive debugging. You can set breakpoints in the code and inspect variables and the program's state interactively.

```python
# Example: Debugging with Python Debugger (pdb)
import pdb

def add(x, y):
    result = x + y
    pdb.set_trace()  # Set breakpoint
    return result

add(5, 10)
```

When you run the code with `pdb.set_trace()`, the execution will pause at that point, and you can interactively inspect variables, execute commands, and step through the code using commands like `next`, `step`, `continue`, `print`, etc.

Understanding how to handle exceptions gracefully and debug code effectively is essential for writing robust and error-free Python programs.
